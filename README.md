## Introduction

So, this is some boilerplate code I use to quickly whip up a Node.js API. The code is written using, mostly, using ES6 bar the stuff that isn't supported by Node.js just yet.

## Why did you bother to make this, Chief?

Node.js is still in it's infancy and I have built a few Node.js APIs in many different ways using different suggestions from the billions of blogs I have read. However, this project is a culmination of what I personally think works well for me. I have made things as modular as I can which allows for some nice testing and keeps the main file small.
